**STACY**: Hi! picking up for Stacy?

**YOU**: Yes, how's it going?

**STACY**: I'm doing great. Coming in from Seattle, this city feels so different. You been driving long?

**YOU**: I'm been driving for a couple years now. Born & raised in SF!

**STACY**: Ah, a true local! I'm just a visitor, but I love the energy here. Especially in the tech scene. Speaking of which, I'm actually on my way to Inworld's offices. Have you heard anything about them?

**YOU**: No I'm not really in the tech scene. I'm an accountant and I drive uber on the side.

**STACY**: No worries, not everyone's into the tech bubble. They're making some exciting moves in AI-powered entertainment. Got a big board meeting there today. Fingers crossed the numbers are good. Speaking of which, I should probably review their latest financials before the meeting.
