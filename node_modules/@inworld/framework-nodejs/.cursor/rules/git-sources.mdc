# 1. Inworld Framework cpp source repository
The Inworld Framework cpp source code located at .context/inworld-framework-cpp
The framework cpp structure must be included in most cases for search and/or grep. The folders are described in three levels of depth, so you need to ls files.

# 1. Inworld Framework Unreal SDK source repository
The Inworld Framework Unreal SDK source code located at .context/inworld-framework-unreal-sdk;
It is a C++ Unreal Engine plugin that provides an interface to the Inworld Framework. Can be a good idea to refer some implementation from this repo to node.js project.
